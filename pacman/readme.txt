Hello, welcome to Pac Man 112!

My project is a recreation of the game Pac Man, where the player controls
Pac-Man in a maze to eat dots, power ups, and ghosts!

To play, just run main.py (no external libraries needed). The game starts
right away just like the real Pac-Man. 

Use the arrow keys to move. If you lose, just press SPACE to restart.
